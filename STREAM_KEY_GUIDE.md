# Stream ID & Stream Key Guide

## Overview

The application now supports two advanced features for stream management:
1. **Reusing Existing Streams** via `streamId`
2. **Custom Stream Names** via `streamKey`

## 1. Reusing Existing Stream (streamId)

### What is it?
Instead of creating a new stream for each broadcast, you can reuse an existing stream that you've already created.

### When to use?
- You have a persistent stream setup with OBS/streaming software
- You want to use the same stream key across multiple broadcasts
- You've already configured a stream with specific settings

### How to use:

1. **Get the Stream ID**:
   - Create a stream manually in YouTube Studio or via API
   - Copy the Stream ID (format: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
   
2. **Add to Excel**:
   ```
   | title       | ... | streamId               |
   |-------------|-----|------------------------|
   | My Broadcast| ... | abc123def456ghi789     |
   ```

3. **Process**: When you run batch processing:
   - App will verify the stream exists
   - Bind broadcast to existing stream
   - **No new stream is created**

### Example:
```
| title          | streamId          | streamKey |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Morning Show   | xyz123abc456      |           |
| Evening Show   | xyz123abc456      |           |
```
Both broadcasts use the **same stream** - you can stream to one stream key for both events.

## 2. Custom Stream Name (streamKey)

### What is it?
Instead of auto-generated stream names like "Stream: My Title", you can specify a custom name.

### When to use?
- You want recognizable stream names in YouTube Studio
- You're organizing multiple streams with specific naming conventions
- You need to identify streams easily

### How to use:

1. **Add to Excel**:
   ```
   | title       | ... | streamId | streamKey          |
   |-------------|-----|----------|--------------------|
   | My Broadcast| ... |          | MainStreamPro2025  |
   ```

2. **Process**: When you run batch processing:
   - App creates a new stream
   - Uses your custom name instead of default
   - Returns the generated stream ID and key

### Example:
```
| title          | streamId | streamKey           |
|----------------|----------|---------------------|
| Gaming Stream  |          | GamingChannelMain   |
| Tutorial       |          | TutorialStream01    |
```

## Best Practices

### Single Persistent Stream
If you stream regularly with the same setup:
1. Create one reusable stream
2. Use the same `streamId` for all broadcasts
3. Configure your streaming software once

### Multiple Broadcasts with Custom Names
If you need unique streams but want organized names:
1. Leave `streamId` empty
2. Set unique `streamKey` for each
3. Each broadcast gets a new stream with your custom name

### Default Auto-Generation
If you don't need these features:
1. Leave both `streamId` and `streamKey` empty
2. App auto-generates everything
3. Each broadcast gets a unique stream

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Weekly Show with Same Stream
```
| title               | streamId          | streamKey |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Weekly Show Ep 1    | mystream123       |           |
| Weekly Show Ep 2    | mystream123       |           |
| Weekly Show Ep 3    | mystream123       |           |
```
**Result**: All episodes use the same stream. Configure OBS once, use for all episodes.

### Scenario 2: Multiple Events with Custom Names
```
| title               | streamId | streamKey        |
|---------------------|----------|------------------|
| Product Launch      |          | Launch2025       |
| Q&A Session         |          | QA_Jan2025       |
| Behind the Scenes   |          | BTS_Special      |
```
**Result**: Each event gets its own stream with a recognizable name.

### Scenario 3: Mix of Both
```
| title               | streamId          | streamKey        |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Main Event          |                   | MainEvent2025    |
| Replay Stream       | existingstream123 |                  |
| Backup Stream       |                   | BackupStream     |
```
**Result**: Flexible setup with new streams, reused streams, and custom names.

## Important Notes

### Stream ID Validation
- App verifies `streamId` exists before binding
- If stream doesn't exist or is invalid, broadcast creation fails
- Error message shows in Logs tab

### Stream Reusability
- Streams created with `isReusable: false` (default)
- To reuse across multiple broadcasts, you may need to manually create reusable streams
- Check YouTube API documentation for stream reusability settings

### Stream Key vs Stream ID
- **Stream Key**: The RTMP key you enter in OBS (generated by YouTube)
- **Stream Name**: The title/label of the stream in YouTube Studio
- **Stream ID**: The unique identifier for the stream resource
- In this app:
  - `streamId` = YouTube's stream resource ID
  - `streamKey` = Custom name/title for the stream (not the RTMP key)

## Troubleshooting

### "Stream ID verification failed"
- Check if the stream ID is correct
- Verify the stream exists in YouTube Studio
- Ensure the stream belongs to the selected channel

### "Stream ID not found"
- The stream may have been deleted
- The stream may belong to a different channel
- Copy the correct stream ID from YouTube Studio

### Stream already bound to another broadcast
- YouTube streams can only be bound to one live broadcast at a time
- Use a different stream ID or leave empty to create a new one

## Getting Stream IDs

### Method 1: YouTube Studio
1. Go to YouTube Studio
2. Click "Content" → "Live"
3. Find your stream (may need to use YouTube Data API to see IDs)

### Method 2: From Previous Broadcasts
1. Run batch processing without `streamId`
2. Check Logs tab for generated stream IDs
3. Copy stream ID for reuse in future broadcasts

### Method 3: YouTube Data API Explorer
1. Use Google's API Explorer: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/liveStreams/list
2. List your streams with `part=id,snippet`
3. Copy the stream IDs you want to reuse
